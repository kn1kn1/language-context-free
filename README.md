# Context Free support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Context Free files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [Context Free TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/context-free.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.

## Rendering (OSX and Linux)

If you have cfdg (Context Free Command-Line Version) and set "cfdg Command Path" setting, you can render .cfdg file from the shortcut `ctrl-shift-r` or clicking `Packages > Context Free > Render` in the menu.

**Please note:** In the example above I installed cfdg from [the Homebrew-cfdg Tap repository](https://github.com/kn1kn1/homebrew-cfdg) and set `/usr/local/bin/cfdg` as "cfdg Command Path".
